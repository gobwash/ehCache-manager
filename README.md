This is a quick and dirty view into ColdFusion's ehCache regions. 

This cfm allows you to see what regions exist in your ehCache setup, view the keys and content in each region and purge/kill a region on command. Additionally, the serialized size of each key's content is displayed to give a (very) rough approximation of the size of the data being stored.
